  <h3>Corporate Project Accomplishments</h3>
  <div class="card">
    <p>From the very beginning, while still in school, I received an invitation from a teacher to intern with their company: Rain, a digital agency. This opportunity granted me the privilege of working with a diverse range of clients worldwide on multimillion-dollar projects. Venturing into the realm of digital agency work became a transformative experience, shaping my understanding of the industry and fostering skills that would prove invaluable in my career journey.</p>
    <p>Continued education has made computer science and technology the ideal industry for building a career. Staying abreast of the latest advancements and trends in these fields not only fuels my passion but also equips me with the knowledge and skills essential for success in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.</p>
    <p>Here are a few of the companies I've built websites for</p>
