  <h3>Projects Developed In A Corporate, Professional Environment.</h3>

  <p>From the very beginning of an illustrious career, upon receiving an invitation from a teacher to join their company, Rain, a digital agency, straight out of college (six month internship), I have had the privilege of working with a wide variety of clients all around the globe.</p>
  <p>From startups reinventing how food is produced and consumed to rebranding international airlines and breaking into new markets, venturing into the unknown was not only exciting but necessary. Continued education made computer science and technology the ideal industry to build a career.</p>
  <p>Here's a few of the website's I have built.</p>
